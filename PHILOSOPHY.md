# Project Philosophy

## Purpose

This project is built **by engineers, for engineers**.

It provides a **toolkit of composable primitives** intended to be used as building blocks in engineering systems. It is not a product, platform, or prescribed solution.

---

## Freedom

Code wants to be free.

Free to be read, modified, composed, discarded, and reused in ways not anticipated by the authors. Forking and selective reuse are expected.

---

## Infrastructure Neutrality

This project does not assume or require any particular infrastructure.

It does not constrain where it runs, how it is deployed, or what it integrates with. There is no hosting model, service boundary, or platform dependency.

---

## Toolkit, Not Product

This project exposes **mechanisms**, not workflows.

It does not encode policy, business logic, or architectural mandates. Composition and usage are left to the engineer.

---

## Anti-Vendor Orientation

This project is the **antithesis of sales- and vendor-driven software**.

It has sharp edges and exposes internal structure. It evolves in response to real engineering use, not market positioning.

---

## Responsibility

You own the systems built with this code.

Outcomes belong to the engineer integrating it, not to a vendor, consultancy, or narrative. This project provides capability, not cover.

---

## Stability of Intent

Implementations may change. Intent should not.

If this project disappears, the work built on top of it should remain intelligible and maintainable.

---

## Non-Goals

This project does not aim to:

* be turnkey
* abstract away responsibility
* hide complexity
* provide enterprise guarantees
